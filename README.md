## Motivation

I love writing [Arduino code for STM32
microcontrollers](https://github.com/stm32duino) but wanted to expand my skill
set to the awesome Rust programming language.  Having looked into [Embedded
Rust](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/), I concluded that the  level of
Rust knowledge required was beyond my current ability to understand and modify.  
To keep the best of both worlds -- the simplicity of the Arduino approach and the
safety of Rust -- I came up with this minimal example of how you can call Rust
code from an Arduino sketch on an STM32 microcontroller.
